<h2><u>About this website</u></h2>
<p><img src="images/NewsImage.jpg" alt="Fake news image"/></p>
<p>This website is being used to help educate people about the dangers of fake news. Most young students will most probably associcate "Fake News" with Donald Trump. However Fake News is much more and has been around for decades. It can be incredibly harmful, which is the reason I created this website. We as a society need to start recognising fake news more, and being able to differentiate between what is real and fake. If we start now, we can protect a whole generation from being trick by media with fake news articles and propaganda.

<h2><u>Why is it important?</u></h2>
<p><img src="images/Virus.jpg" alt="Fake news image"/></p>
<p> When false information is reported on as a fact, a lot of people believe it based on the reputation of the media, and their role of delivering information to the public. Many companies such as Instagram and Twitter have moved to include a "fact checking" algorithm in their applications. This encourages users to check the source of the information before sharing it. This is something that I think more companies should move to include in their software in order to decrease the spread of the virus that is fake news. A survey produced by Visme.com concluded that 47% of people do not check the facts behind content before sharing it. I believe the real figure is a lot more than that when you include social media and how every second there are millions of things being shared without checking the facts. Facebook is notorious for having a wide spread of Fake News articles which get spread around and make people believe they are true. This is something that we need to push to eliminate, in order to protect ourselves from the aforementioned dangers of fake news.
