<h2><u>What is Fake News?</u></h2>
<p><img src="images/fakenews1.jpg" alt="Fake news image"/></p>
<p> Fake news are any kinds of News articles and stories that are not true. There are two main types of fake news. One being false stories that are deliberately published or sent around, in order to make people believe something untrue or to get lots of people to visit a website. These are deliberate lies that are put online, even though the person writing them knows that they are made up. </p>

<p>Another type is stories that may have some truth to them, but they're not completely accurate. This is because the people writing them - for example, journalists or bloggers - don't check all of the facts before publishing the story, or they might exaggerate some of it.

<h2><u>Dangers of Fake News</u></h2>
<p><img src="images/News-phone.jpg" alt="Fake news image"/></p>
<p>Fake news is a huge problem in todays generation where most of our News resources are online, independant news companies. The first kind of fake news is deliberate lies, this is a problem because it can make people believe things that are completely untrue. The second kind is when people publish something without checking that it's completely right, this can make people have less trust in the media, as well as make everyone believe something that might be inaccurate.
</p>

<p> People also only tend to share things that they agree with. So if people are sharing a lot of fake news, and lots of people believe it, it's easy to get sucked into a bubble that is actually completely different to the real world - and a long way from the truth.
