<h1><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></h1>


<h2><u>How do I know the difference between "Fake News" and an opinion?</u></h2>
<p>Both fact and opinion help us understand
the world around us. Facts are accurate 
reports of what happened or what exists,
while opinions are an interpretation of
the meaning or impact, usually from an
individual's perspective. It’s legitimate for
an opinion to be influenced by a person’s
world view, but even those who express
an opinion should back them up with
facts rather than inaccurate information. </p>

<h2><u> How can you spot fake news?</u></h2>
<p>Consider the source and other stories
coming from that source. Do they ring
true? Is the URL legitimate? Does the
“news story” seem one-sided or biased
toward a particular point of view? Also,
consider the article’s author. Is there
evidence that it’s a real person? Search
for the source and author to see what
else they’ve published and what others
are saying about them. Sometimes you
can tell if a story is true by copying a
string of its text and pasting it into a
search engine. Often (but not always) this
will bring up sites that may dispute or
confirm the story, but it may also bring
up other fake news sites that repeat the
story. FactCheck.org has other good tips
for spotting fake news. </p>

<h2><u> What should I do if I spot Fake News?</u></h2>
<p>While it’s never OK to spread fake news,
it is OK to comment on links to fake
stories with your own correction, to help
set the record straight. This can help make the authors understand 
that their website is spreading false news, as well as notifying
readers that the article may not be 100% factual. This can prevent it spreading
while also giving authors of fake news something to worry about as they would not want 
to ruin their reputation </p>
